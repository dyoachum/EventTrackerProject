## Event Tracker Project


### Overview
Warzone project uses Spring REST CRUD API. When fully developed it will be able to track and update a player or teams kill count per match of   Warzone.  Right now when you make a request to the api, it returns a list of players with their individual id numbers, their GamerTags and their kill count.
